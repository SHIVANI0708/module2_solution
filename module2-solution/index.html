                <h2>Arayabhata</h2>
                <p>
                    Aryabhata, also called Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder, (born 476, possibly Ashmaka or Kusumapura, India), astronomer and the earliest Indian mathematician whose work and history are available to modern scholars.
                    He is also known as Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder to distinguish him from a 10th-century Indian mathematician of the same name. He flourished in Kusumapura—near Patalipurta (Patna), then the capital of the Gupta
                    dynasty—where he composed at least two works, Aryabhatiya (c. 499) and the now lost Aryabhatasiddhanta.

                <h2>Srinivasa Ramanujan</h2>
                <p>
                   Srinivasa Ramanujan, (born December 22, 1887, Erode, India—died April 26, 1920, Kumbakonam), Indian mathematician whose contributions to the theory of numbers include pioneering discoveries of the properties of the
                   partition function.When he was 15 years old, he obtained a copy of George Shoobridge Carr’s Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, 2 vol. (1880–86). This collection of thousands of theorems,
                   many presented with only the briefest of proofs and with no material newer than 1860, aroused his genius. Having verified the results in Carr’s book, Ramanujan went beyond it, developing his own theorems and ideas.

                <p>
                    Bhāskara II, also called Bhāskarācārya or Bhaskara the Learned, (born 1114, Biddur, India—died c. 1185, probably Ujjain), the leading mathematician of the 12th century, who wrote the first work with full and
                    systematic use of the decimal number system.Bhāskara II was the lineal successor of the noted Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (598–c. 665) as head of an astronomical observatory at Ujjain, the leading
                    mathematical centre of ancient India. The II has been attached to his name to distinguish him from the 7th-century astronomer of the same name.
